img_1.png|"Score: 72/100 – Solid performance with good visual clarity.
Snack ads aimed at younger mobile users (18–24) tend to perform better when the design is clean and low on text — just like this one. The strong contrast and tidy layout likely helped it stand out, even without a CTA. View time was solid, and the click suggests the visual did its job. To push performance further, adding a bold, branded CTA could make next steps clearer.
What's working:
• Low text density makes it easy to scan on mobile
• Strong contrast helps key elements stand out
• Brand colors are lightly present but not overpowering
What’s not working:
• No clear call-to-action, which might limit conversions
• Visual focus is slightly off-center, which may reduce engagement
Suggestion:
Try adding a simple, high-contrast CTA to guide action and balance the layout to draw attention more effectively."
img_2.png|"Score: 80/100 – Visually strong and engaging.
This carousel-style mobile ad connected well with users aged 25–34. The high brand color usage reinforces identity, and the pairing of lifestyle and product visuals gives it an authentic, dynamic feel. View time and clicks show the experience resonated, though it could benefit from clearer guidance. A CTA could help nudge more users to take action.
What's working:
• High brand color usage boosts recognition
• Carousel format with lifestyle + product imagery keeps interest
• Moderate contrast and motion-like layout maintain attention
What’s not working:
• No CTA present, so it may lack direction
• Layout feels slightly dense on smaller screens
Suggestion:
Adding a CTA like “Shop Now” could make the user path clearer and potentially increase clicks."
img_3.png|"Score: 58/100 – Clear but underperforming.
This ad has a clean structure and is easy to follow, but it didn't get a click. For an older mobile audience (55+), clarity and contrast are especially important. This version feels a bit text-heavy and lacked a strong visual cue to act. A CTA or stronger contrast might have helped break through.
What's working:
• Centered layout helps guide the eye
• Clean visual hierarchy makes it easy to follow
What’s not working:
• Contrast is low, which can reduce visual impact
• No CTA and slightly high text density may have contributed to the missed click
Suggestion:
Consider simplifying the copy and adding color contrast or texture to draw more attention."
img_4.png|"Score: 64/100 – High visual impact, but not converting.
This desktop ad for younger users (18–24) pops visually thanks to high contrast and strong brand presence. But without a CTA, it may leave users unsure of the next step. And while the layout is clean, the heavier text load might slow the viewer down. Performance would likely improve with simplified copy and clearer direction.
What's working:
• Excellent contrast – the ad visually pops
• Strong brand color usage creates instant recognition
• Centered design makes it visually cohesive
What’s not working:
• No CTA limits clarity on what to do next
• High text density may overwhelm, especially on desktop
Suggestion:
Introduce a CTA and trim unnecessary text to direct attention more efficiently."
img_5.png|"Score: 69 – Got the click, but room to tighten up.
This desktop ad reached its goal, but not without some friction. The text is dense and the contrast is soft, which can reduce scannability. The CTA is present but could be more visually emphasized. Still, the click proves the concept is strong. With a bit more clarity and focus, this design could go from good to great.
What's working:
• CTA is present and visible
• Good alignment with desktop format
• Click shows it resonated with some users
What’s not working:
• Text is very dense and could deter some users
• Contrast is soft, and brand colors don’t stand out much
Suggestion:
Refine the copy to focus on key benefits, and consider boosting the visual contrast to help the CTA pop."
